Rule to filter diff
- if 0 => keep
- if 1 => keep
- if -1 and r == 0 and l == 0 => is candidate
    - if r.start and l.end are not punct => is midsyl
    - if has \d+་?\D་?\d+ => tag as page annotation
    - if has number or ) => is marker
    - if is patterns* => is marker
    - if is space or punct => ignore
    - if l.end is not punct and r.start is tseg => noisy lone marker

- if -1 and r == 1 => is candidate
    - if r.start and l.end are not punct => is midsyl
    - if has number or ) => is noisy marker
    - if is (not space or punct) and (l is space or punct) => is noisy marker

noisy marker
    - move l to r and change to 0
    - keep marker

mid syl
    - if has marker
	- if r.first is space
		- add marker after the left
	- if l.last is space
		- add marker after second last syl of left
	- else
		- move l.last to right and add marker before l.last
    - else
	- ignore cur diff

    - ignore current and add prefix(cor) to l
